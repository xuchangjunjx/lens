# Adding Clusters

Add clusters by clicking the **Add Cluster** button in the left-side menu. 

1. Click the **Add Cluster** button (indicated with a '+' icon).
2. Enter the path to your kubeconfig file. You'll need to have a kubeconfig file for the cluster you want to add. You can either browse for the path from the file system or or enter it directly.

Selected [cluster contexts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/#context) are added as a separate item in the left-side cluster menu to allow you to operate easily on multiple clusters and/or contexts.

**NOTE**: Any cluster that you added manually will not be merged into your kubeconfig file.

To see your currently-enabled config with `kubectl`, enter `kubectl config view --minify --raw` in your terminal.
