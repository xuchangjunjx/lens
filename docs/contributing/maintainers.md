# Maintainers

We are looking for community maintainers for the Lens project. Maintainers will be added to a special team with write permissions. These permissions consist of opening, closing, tagging, and editing issues and pull requests, as well as creating and deleting non-protected branches.

The responsibilities of a community maintainer are listed below.

## Issues Triage

* **Labeling Issues:** Label issues accordingly.
* **Finding Duplicates:** Finding and closing duplicate issues.
* **Doing First Level Contact:** Getting more information on the issues (like version number or asking for clarification) if needed.
* **Closing Irrelevant Issues:** Closing issues that are determined irrelevant, no longer needed, not relevant to the project and/or don't follow the issues guidelines.

## Help with Contributions

* **Help Manage Pull Requests:** Help the author of the pull request with any problems.
* **Contributing:** Create pull requests to help maintain and drive the project forward.
